# Angular Practice Repository

This repository contains multiple Angular projects I worked on while learning and applying Angular concepts.  

## ðŸ“Œ Important Note for Supervisor
Among the projects here, **`pomodoro-app/`** is my **final project**.  
All other projects are small test projects created to practice Angular fundamentals such as routing, directives, forms, and project setup.
